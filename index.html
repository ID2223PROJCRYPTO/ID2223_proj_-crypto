    <h1>Crypto Price Direction Prediction</h1>

    <p>
      This project focuses on predicting the
      <strong>24-hour price direction of Bitcoin (BTC)</strong> using machine
      learning models trained on historical price data and engineered market
      features. The goal is not exact price forecasting, but
      <em>binary classification</em>: whether the price will go
      <strong>up</strong> or <strong>down</strong> on the next day.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <strong>Task type:</strong> Binary classification<br />
      <strong>Target:</strong> BTC price direction (t + 24h)<br />
      <strong>Features:</strong> Price-based indicators & engineered features
    </div>

    <h2>Method Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The pipeline consists of data ingestion, feature engineering, model
      training, and evaluation. Raw market data is transformed into supervised
      learning samples using a time-aware labeling strategy to avoid data
      leakage.

      <li>Feature engineering (returns, trends, lag features)</li>
      <li>Supervised learning model training</li>
      <li>Evaluation using classification metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Experimental Results</h2>

    <h3>Confusion Matrix</h3>

    />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 1: Confusion matrix showing the distribution of correct and
      incorrect predictions.
    </div>

    <p>
      The confusion matrix illustrates the model's ability to distinguish upward
      and downward price movements. While false positives and false negatives
      remain, the diagonal dominance indicates meaningful predictive signal.
    </p>

    <h3>Feature Importance</h3>

    <div class="caption">
      Figure 2: Relative importance of input features used by the model.
    </div>

    <p>
      Feature importance analysis suggests that recent price movements and
      short-term trend indicators contribute most significantly to the
      prediction outcome.
    </p>

    <h3>Prediction vs Actual</h3>

      time.
    </div>

    <p>
      This visualization compares predicted signals with ground truth labels,
      highlighting periods where the model captures market trends as well as
      intervals of increased volatility where performance degrades.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied
      to financial time-series classification problems. Although market
      prediction remains inherently uncertain, the results indicate that
      engineered features combined with supervised learning models can extract
      non-trivial predictive patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Future improvements may include incorporating additional external signals,
      model ensembling, and more advanced temporal architectures.
